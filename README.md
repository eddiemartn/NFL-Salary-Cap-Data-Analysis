NFL Salary Cap Data Analysis

This project takes you through a deep dive into how teams manage their salary cap. It also shows whether or not the amount of cap space a team has remaining influences its success. The goal of this project was to see if there is any correlation between the two variables and to find out if any trends are going on league-wide regarding salary cap strategy and usage. This report should provide you with some understanding of how the salary cap works and what its effect on teams is.
